# Air Quality Monitoring & CSTPS Impact Analysis – Chandrapur

This project analyzes ambient air quality in Chandrapur (Maharashtra) using CPCB daily data for 2024.

## Objective
- Compare pollution levels between residential (Chauhan Colony) and industrial (MIDC) stations
- Quantify the contribution of CSTPS to local air pollution
- Study PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, CO, and Ozone trends

## Data Source
- Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB)
- Daily average data (Jan–Dec 2024)

## Stations Analyzed
- Chauhan Colony, Chandrapur
- MIDC, Chandrapur (near CSTPS)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Excel (CPCB data)
